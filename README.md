I am making a great effort to develop myself from the ground up and become a well-equipped expert in data analysis.

## Goals:
I am continuously developing myself in the field of data analytics, aiming to master this area from the ground up. Additionally, I want to take an active role in data science projects, extracting meaningful insights from complex data sets and integrating these insights into decision support processes.
